# kaleidoscope-rs
An implementation of the LLVM tutorial in idiomatic Rust.

## What is this?
This my attempt to work through [the awesome LLVM tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/) using Rust instead of C++. I'm trying to use idiomatic Rust instead of a line per line port.

As I complete each chapter you can find the results in that chapter's branch. Master will always be the latest complete chapter's code.

## License
This project is released under the Unlicense because I don't want to add all the crazy restrictions on what people can do with this code like the GNU licenses do. Do whatever you want with this code, just don't sue me if things go wrong (which I highly doubt will happen). If you do use this code, I would like for you to credit me, but you don't have to.
